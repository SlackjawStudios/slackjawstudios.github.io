> I should just create a shitty game. A game I don't care about or take much pride in, but one that's actually finished.

That's the thought I tend to have in the back of my mind. It's even the advice that the entire gamedev community seems to provide.

But I just can't. I can't bring myself to build a game that doesn't try to set itself apart, or a game I am not proud of.

This leads me to always be one foot in, one foot out. Every time I start pursuing some cool new project idea, I end up canceling it because it's likely too much work, or so I am told. The advice is always to do the smallest game possible, unless you have a full team.

So this is an effort to chronicle my progress as I try to go against the grain. I am attempting to go all-in on a game I *actually* want to build, even though the scope is larger than people recommend.

For now, the project is called **Jericho** (since I need something to use as a C# namespace...). I will be putting up a post each week to show the latest progress, to discuss challenges along the way, workflows, and to show screenshots and GIFs when possible.

Aaaaaaand begin!
