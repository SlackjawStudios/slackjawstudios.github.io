> Welp.

So I don't have a demo. Not yet.

Not only does life get in the way sometimes, but I also just need to add some more polish before I can feel good about distributing a demo.

Forgive, but never forget.

Anyway, here are the (few) changes this week.

### Sweet new slimes

I pulled down some new placeholder art from [opengameart.org](http://opengameart.org/). I haven't finished getting the slimes properly animated, but you can at least see a preview of it here.

### Gem pickup sounds

Instead of randomly varying the audio pitch when picking up gems, the pitch will be slowly incremented after rapid pickups. This makes it really satisfying to pickup lots of gems at once.

### More room changes

Last week, I modified the training room to be a bit more interesting. Apparently I overdid it. The platforms were all positioned in a way that made the player stretch a bit too much when jumping. This made jumps feel weak.

With closer platforms, the player feels a bit more comfortable navigating around.

### Sneak peek

Here's a quick peek at an upcoming side-project next month.

While I do not want to deviate from Jericho, this side-project will be a short evaluation of the upcoming Unity Networking library.

### Next week

That's it for now. I don't like having such little progress to report, so next week I will be back on track!

1. Add the “game rules” around waves and spawners.
1. Finish polishing up the slimes a bit, specifically on the jump animation.

Thanks for reading!
