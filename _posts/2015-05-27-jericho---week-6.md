> Treasure galore.

This week's update is pretty small. Holidays tend to do that.

Here we go.

### Treasure chests

Treasure chests now spawn in the training room.

A player can destroy a chest to get the sweet nectar inside.

### Training room update

The training room got a bit of a makeover. It's slightly less boring.

### Boss time

The wizard enemy just felt like it needed a boss version. And, of course, bosses have to be twice as big as their minion counterparts.

Being large and in charge isn't enough, so this guy also can decide to throw slimes around!

### Next week

That's it for this week's tiny update. Next week will cover:

1. Add a fireball attack to the boss that follows the same radial pattern of the slime emitter.
1. Begin adding the "game rules" around waves and spawners.

If all goes well, I hope to have a playable demo by the end of week 7!
